# Create a stram, maybe a separate thread where the user input will
# Add some random events that could change the pet's state:
# Pet might get sick (lowering energy and happiness).
# Pet might find a toy (boosting happiness).


# Game Logic:
# Implement a game loop where the player can choose between feeding, playing, or letting the pet sleep.
# The game loop should also check if the pet is too hungry, tired, or unhappy to continue.

#Allow random events:
# Add some random events that could change the pet's state:
# Pet might get sick (lowering energy and happiness).
# Pet might find a toy (boosting happiness).
# Use the random module to trigger these events with a probability.

# Bonus Features:
# Add more features like the pet's age, where the pet gets older and its attributes change.
# Implement a pet health meter that displays the petâ€™s overall health. If the health reaches 0, the pet becomes "unhappy" and the game ends.

# Bonus task: pass name and pet name as kwargs
